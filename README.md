# VANET_Simulations
The purpose of this effort is to help BS, MSc\MS, and PhD students, who are working on VANET related projects. 
We will focus on the simulations of smart vehicles using the SUMO, OMNET++, & Veins simulation framework. 
I am thankful to the community of USP and FAPESP for sponsering my work.
